SendGrid Integration for Drupal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is not affiliated with SendGrid, Inc.

Use the issue tracker located at [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/sendgrid_integration)
for bug reports or questions about this module. If you want more info about
SendGrid services, contact [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com).

This module uses a wrapper library for the SendGrid API. At the moment the
wrapper library is for V2 of the API. V3 upgrade is being developed.

FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module overrides default email sending behaviour and sending emails through
SendGrid Transactional Email service instead. Emails are sent via a web service
and does not function like SMTP therefore there are certain caveats with other
email formating modules. Read below for details.

Failures to send are re-queued for sending later. Queue of failed messages are
run on a 60 minute interval.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module dependencies:

Drupal's Mailsystem needs to be changed to use SendGrid.  This can be done with
one of:

* Mailsystem module.  A GUI for controlling which Mailsystem is used for which
emails.
* Hardcode in settings.php:

```
$conf['mail_system'] = array('default-system' => 'SendGridMailSystem');
```

This module requires that the SendGrid API Wrapper class is available. You may
accomplish this with:

* Composer Manager module (see below).
* X Autoload module (see below).
* Roll your own.


COMPOSER MANAGER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composer Manager (https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_manager) - A Drupal
module to facilitate the use of Composer (https://getcomposer.org) on a 
per-module basis.

Composer is the definitive source for PHP dependencies, but implementing
Composer in modules is difficult to say the least. Composer typically acts over
an entire project - in this case it would be your entire Drupal source code.
Composer manager allows for modules to declare their own composer.json file
rather than a project global composer.json.

Running Composer and composer manager will require command line access via
DRUSH. There is no GUI for this tool.

X Autoload
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This method may not work if have another install of Guzzle in your
codebase.

1. Download and install [X Autoload module](https://www.drupal.org/project/xautoload).
2. Install the libraries:

```
cd path/to/sendgrid_integration
composer install
```

INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing this module requires some more advanced knowledge, use of the command
line and the use of Drush.

1. Move this folder under modules directory of your installation,
   example sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules

2. Install Dependencies. 
   * If you are using Composer manager: 
   Use Drush to update dependencies via composer 
   `drush composer-manager update --no-dev`.    This will download the Sendgrid 
   API. It is important to use the --no-dev option so you do not download 
   libraries that are used for development and testing only.

3. Navigate to Modules and enable SendGrid Integration in the Mail category.

4. Configure your SendGrid API-Key in admin/config/services/sendgrid

5. Confirm that the mail system is setup to use Sendgrid for how you wish to run
   you website. If you want it all to run through Sendgrid then you set the
   System-wide default MailSystemInterface class to "SendGridMailSystem". As an
   example, see this [image](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/sengrid-integration-mailsystem-settings-example.png).

HTML Email
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to send HTML email. Your installation of Drupal must generate an email
with the proper headers. Sendgrid Integration modules looks for the content type
of the email to be set to "text/html" in the header (i.e. "Content-Type"="text/html").
A text version of the email is also sent at the same time.

If the message does not have the content type set to "text/html" the message
will be stripped of any tags and converted to text.

We recommend using the module [HTMLmail](https://www.drupal.org/project/htmlmail)
for HTML formating of emails. This module allows for easy templating of emails
and it sets the correct header on emails (text/html).

We do not recommend MIMEmail module because it sets the content-type header of a
message to "multipart/mixed" instead of strictly "text/html". In addition, the
MIMEmail module attempts to template emails and include inline CSS that is not
compatible with SendGrid template system. If you want to use
MIMEmail, we suggest using the [SMTP module](https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp)
and not this module.

If you want to work on a solution for MIMEmail and contribute it back to the
module, we gladly accept community contributions!


OPTIONAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If sending email fails with certain (pre-defined) response codes the message be
added to Cron Queue for later delivery. In order for this to function, you must
configure Cron running period and when it is possible also add your drupal site
to crontab (Linux only), read more about cron at https://www.drupal.org/cron.

If you would like a record of the emails being sent by the website, installing
Maillog (https://www.drupal.org/project/maillog) will allow you to store local
copies of the emails sent. Sendgrid does not store the content of the email.

DEBUGGING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging this module while installed can be done by installing the Maillog
module (https://www.drupal.org/project/maillog). This module will allow you to
store the emails locally before they are sent and view the message generated
in the Sendgrid email object.
